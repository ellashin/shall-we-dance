<p style="margin-top:45px;"><strong>La La Land</strong> is a 2016 American romantic comedy musical film written and directed by Damien Chazelle. It stars Ryan Gosling as a jazz pianist and Emma Stoe as an aspiring actress, who meet and fall in love in Los Angeles while pursuing their dreams. The film's title refers simultaneously to the city of Los Angeles and the idiom for being out of touch with reality.

Chazelle wrote the screenplay in 2010 but did not find a studio willing to finance the production without changes to his design. Following the success of his 2014 film Whiplash, the project was picked up by Summit Entertainment. Filming took place from August to September 2015 in Los Angeles. La La Land premiered at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival on August 31, 2016, and was released in the United States on December 9, 2016. It grossed $446 million worldwide against a production budget of $30 million.</p>
